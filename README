NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::Nitesi - Nitesi Shop Machine plugin for Dancer

VERSION
    Version 0.0020

SYNOPSIS
        use Dancer::Plugin::Nitesi;

        cart->add({sku => 'ABC', name => 'Foobar', quantity => 1, price => 42});
        cart->items();

        account->login(username => 'frank@nitesi.com', password => 'nevairbe');
        account->acl(check => 'view_prices');
        account->logout();

CARTS
    The cart keyword returns a Nitesi::Cart object with the corresponding
    methods.

    You can use multiple carts like that:

        cart('wishlist')->add({sku => 'ABC', name => 'Foobar', quantity => 1, price => 42});
        cart('wishlist')->total;

    The DBI backend (Dancer::Plugin::Nitesi::Cart::DBI) allows you to load
    carts of arbitrary users.

        cart('', 123)->items;
